# 🌱 PlantVision AI

**PlantVision AI** is an intelligent, web-based platform for the automated detection and classification of plant health, with a focus on identifying *Armillaria* fungal infections in cherry trees. By integrating multi-sensor data (RGB and multispectral images) with advanced AI techniques, the platform leverages state-of-the-art **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify infection stages — enabling precise, early intervention and enhanced agricultural decision-making.

Developed as part of the final year project for the **Computer Engineering and Emerging Technologies (2ITE)** program at **ENSA El Jadida**, under the supervision of **Mr. Fahd Kalloubi**.

## 📖 Project Overview

The goal of **PlantVision AI** is to create an interactive platform that leverages deep learning models for analyzing plant health through RGB and multispectral imagery. It incorporates cutting-edge CNN architectures — **ResNet**, **EfficientNet**, **Xception**, and **DenseNet** — and implements both **early** and **late fusion strategies** to maximize classification accuracy.

Built with **Streamlit**, the platform allows users to:
- Upload images
- Select analysis modalities
- View infection stage predictions with corresponding confidence scores

---

## ✨ Features

- 📤 **Image Upload**: Supports uploading of RGB images, multispectral images, or both.
- 🔍 **Model Selection**: Choose between unimodal (RGB or multispectral) and multimodal (fusion of both) models.
- 🌿 **Infection Stage Classification**: Classifies plant health into:
  - Healthy 🌳
  - Stage 1 (Early Infection) 🌱
  - Stage 2 (Moderate Infection) 🍂
  - Stage 3 (Advanced Infection) 🍁
- 🎛️ **Interactive Interface**: Streamlit-powered, user-friendly web UI.
- 📊 **Performance Metrics**: Displays prediction results with confidence levels.
- 📈 **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design allows easy integration of new diseases or sensors.
